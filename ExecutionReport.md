# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Recap of PropelAI's Vision
## Personal Motivation
As a team of students about to venture into the professional world, we recognise that one of the most significant challenges that we, and many others will face, is navigating interviews and public speaking. Mastering these skills can be a daunting task and furthermore, they are crucial for the job application process. Our own struggles and experiences inspired the creation and development of our start-up: PropelAI.

We felt passionate about creating an intuitive application that will help working professionals excel at public speaking and ace interviews with confidence. This report documents our initial business execution steps and the beginning of our journey.

## The Communication Crisis in Professional settings
In today's knowledge economy, communication effectiveness has become the defining factor in career advancement. Studies show that 74% of employers rank communication skills as the most desirable quality in candidates, yet 77% of professionals report experiencing significant anxiety when speaking publicly. This disconnect costs individuals countless career opportunities and organizations billions in productivity losses annually. Despite communication being more critical than ever in remote and hybrid work environments, traditional training methods have failed to evolve beyond generic advice and outdated practices.

## Our Solution: PropelAI

PropelAI is an innovative AI-powered communication platform designed to transform professionals' preparation for career-defining speaking moments. Through its dual offerings—PropelAI for public speaking and presentation skills and PropelAI for interview preparation—the platform addresses the critical gap between conventional communication training and the real-world demands of today's competitive professional landscape. By leveraging advanced AI technology, real-time feedback mechanisms, and personalised learning pathways, PropelAI enables users to master communication skills that directly align with employer expectations and industry standards.


# 2. The Customer
## 2.1 Who is our Customer?

We identified three primary target customer groups that we deemed would most benefit from our product. Through market research we further justified this selection.

![Customers](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/customers.png)

1.	Active job seekers.
These are individuals who are currently in the process of applying for jobs and preparing for interviews. PropelAI will provide the tools needed to practice common interview scenarios and improve clarity as well as confidence of communication. 

2.	Professionals seeking career advancement.
Our application also caters to those currently employed but who are striving to migrate to a different job. Often, time is scarce for individuals in this situation; operating a full-time job alongside the search process is exhaustive. Instead of manual preparation, our application aims to streamline the process of interview preparation for a new role/ new company. 

3.	Higher education students.
These individuals could be soon to be graduates, looking to apply for a graduate scheme or a first-year student searching for an internship. Students at university or enrolled in other academic programs who are preparing to join the workforce often face the struggle of having limited interview and public speaking experience. 

Our tool presents a solution to ensuring students get the confidence and skills needed to navigate professional environments.  We wanted to create an application that we could benefit from ourselves when breaking into the job market and furthermore in our professional careers.

This approach ensures that: 
•	The product is affordable to those who need it most. 
•	Revenue comes from multiple channels (B2C + B2B). 
•	The product remains scalable, as the AI backend allows for high-quality coaching without hiring human trainers.


## 3.1.5 Real value delivered to users (not just features)

PropelAI’s value isn’t only in its features, but in how it makes a real difference in people’s confidence, communication, and career. Here’s how:
•	Builds real-world communication skills – not just for interviews, but for meetings, presentations, pitches, and group discussions. 

•	Reduces speaking anxiety – through repetition, feedback, and a safe space to practice. 
•	Saves time – no need to book coaches or search the internet for tips; everything is built into the app. 
•	Prepares users for life – communication is a lifelong skill, and PropelAI helps build it from the ground up.

- **Mitigation Plan:** We're exploring edge processing for certain analysis components and investigating optimization techniques to ensure responsive performance even on lower-bandwidth connections.

  ## 4.2 Market Challenges
As we've begun introducing PropelAI to the market, several key validation challenges have emerged:

### **Communicating AI-Powered Value Proposition**
- **Challenge:** Many potential users struggle to understand how AI-driven feedback differs from traditional communication training or simple recording and playback solutions.
- **Evidence:** In our initial user interviews, approximately 60% of participants asked for clarification about how the AI would analyze their communication effectively.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** We've revised our demonstration script to include concrete examples of AI-powered insights. We're also developing simple comparison graphics that illustrate the difference between traditional and AI-enhanced communication coaching.

### **Feature Prioritization Based on User Feedback**
- **Challenge:** User feedback has revealed divergent priorities between different segments of our target market. Early-career professionals prioritize interview preparation, while more established professionals seek presentation coaching.
- **Evidence:** Our survey of 25 potential users showed a clear split in priority features based on professional experience level.
