# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Recap of PropelAI's Vision
## Personal Motivation
As a team of students about to venture into the professional world, we recognise that one of the most significant challenges that we, and many others will face, is navigating interviews and public speaking. Mastering these skills can be a daunting task and furthermore, these skills are crucial for the job application process. Our own struggles and experiences inspired the creation and development of our start-up: PropelAI.

We felt passionate about creating an intuitive application that will help working professionals excel at public speaking and ace interviews with confidence. This report documents our initial business execution steps and the beginning of our journey.

## The Communication Crisis in Professional settings
Communication effectiveness has become the defining factor in career advancement. Studies show that 74% of employers rank communication skills as the most desirable quality in candidates, yet 77% of professionals report experiencing significant anxiety when speaking publicly. This disconnect costs individuals countless career opportunities and organizations billions in productivity losses annually. Despite communication being more critical than ever in remote and hybrid work environments, traditional training methods have failed to evolve beyond generic advice and outdated practices.

## Our Solution: PropelAI
![image](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/propelai%20logo.png)
PropelAI is an innovative AI-powered communication platform designed to transform professionals' preparation for career-defining speaking moments. Through its dual offerings—PropelAI for public speaking and presentation skills and PropelAI for interview preparation—the platform addresses the critical gap between conventional communication training and the real-world demands of today's competitive professional landscape. By leveraging advanced AI technology, real-time feedback mechanisms, and personalised learning pathways, PropelAI enables users to master communication skills that directly align with employer expectations and industry standards.


# 2. The Customer
## 2.1 Who is our Customer?

We identified three primary target customer groups that we deemed would most benefit from our product. Through market research we further justified this selection.

![Customers](https://github.com/abisolap123/Entrepreneurship/blob/main/customers.png)

**1.	Active job seekers.**

These are individuals who are currently in the process of applying for jobs and preparing for interviews. PropelAI will provide the tools needed to practice common interview scenarios and improve clarity as well as confidence of communication. 

**2.	Professionals seeking career advancement.**

Our application also caters to those currently employed but who are striving to migrate to a different job. Often, time is scarce for individuals in this situation; operating a full-time job alongside the search process is exhausting. Instead of manual preparation, our application aims to streamline the process of interview preparation for a new role/ new company. 

**3.	Higher education students.**

These individuals could be soon to be graduates, looking to apply for a graduate scheme or a first-year student searching for an internship. Students at university or enrolled in other academic programs who are preparing to join the workforce often face the struggle of having limited interview and public speaking experience. Our tool presents a solution to ensuring students get the confidence and skills needed to navigate professional environments.  

*We wanted to create an application that we could benefit from ourselves when breaking into the job market and furthermore down the line in our professional careers.*

# 4. Development Challenges
The development of the business has not always been smooth sailing, this section details some of the key challenges we encountered and our solution steps to tackle them.

## 4.1 Technical Challenges

### **AI Implementation Barriers**
- **Challenge:** Developing an AI system capable of analyzing communication patterns, providing contextual feedback, and adapting to different professional scenarios requires specialized expertise and substantial training data.
- **Mitigation Plan:** We're pursuing a hybrid approach that leverages existing AI services (such as Azure Cognitive Services or Google Cloud NLP) for our MVP, while simultaneously developing a roadmap for more specialized models as we gather user data and feedback.

### **Technical Performance Considerations**
- **Challenge:** Real-time communication analysis requires efficient processing to provide timely feedback without degrading user experience.
- **Mitigation Plan:** We're exploring edge processing for certain analysis components and investigating optimization techniques to ensure responsive performance even on lower-bandwidth connections.

## 4.2 Market Challenges
As we've begun introducing PropelAI to the market, several key validation challenges have emerged:

### **Communicating AI-Powered Value Proposition**
- **Challenge:** Many potential users struggle to understand how AI-driven feedback differs from traditional communication training or simple recording and playback solutions.
- **Evidence:** In our initial user interviews, approximately 60% of participants asked for clarification about how the AI would analyze their communication effectively.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** We've revised our demonstration script to include concrete examples of AI-powered insights. We're also developing simple comparison graphics that illustrate the difference between traditional and AI-enhanced communication coaching.


### **Differentiation in a Competitive Landscape**

- **Challenge:** As we've expanded our market research, we've identified several adjacent competitors with overlapping value propositions, making clear differentiation critical.
- **Evidence:** Competitive analysis identified 3 existing solutions with partial feature overlap, though none offering our specific combination of interview and presentation coaching.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** We've refined our messaging to emphasize PropelAI's comprehensive approach to professional communication, highlighting the advantage of a unified platform that addresses multiple communication scenarios within a consistent learning environment.
